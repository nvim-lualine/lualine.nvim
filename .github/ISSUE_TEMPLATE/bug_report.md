  This script can help you with that.

  Create an isolated config directory with:

    `nvim_isolated_conf.sh -c DirectoryName`

  Then modify the DirectoryName/.config/nvim/init.vim
  so you can reproduce the issue .

    `nvim_isolated_conf.sh -e DirectoryName`

  the init.vim will have instructions on how and where to place
  your config don't worry if you don't know viml you can get away
  with lua even in a vim file.

  Then you can load the config in an isolated environment to see
  if the issue is occuring with

    `nvim_isolated_conf.sh -l DirectoryName`
